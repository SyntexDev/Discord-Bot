## Contributing

This project is a one-person project, and I am using it to learn how things work. As this repository only contains .md files that showcase my progress, I am not accepting contributions at this time. 

The goal of this repository is to display my learning journey and the steps I am taking in developing a Discord bot using Node.js. I appreciate your understanding!
