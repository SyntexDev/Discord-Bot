# Command - Unban

The `/unban` command is used to remove a ban from a user, allowing them to rejoin the server. When executed, the specified userâ€™s ban is removed, and they are once again able to log in and participate in the server.

This command requires administrator permissions and can only be executed by server admins or users with the appropriate role. It is a useful tool for server administrators to reverse bans when needed.
