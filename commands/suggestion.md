# Command - Suggestion

The `/suggestion` command allows users to submit a suggestion that will be posted in a specific channel. When executed, others can react with emojis to vote on whether the suggestion should be added or removed. A thread is also created for further discussion of the suggestion.

This command is typically available to all users and encourages community involvement in shaping the server's features.
