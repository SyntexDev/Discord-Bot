# Command - Ban

The `/ban` command is used to ban a user from the server. When executed, the specified user is permanently banned and will no longer be able to log in or participate in the server unless the ban is removed.

This command requires administrator permissions and can only be executed by server admins or users with the appropriate role. It is a powerful tool for server administrators to prevent unwanted behavior and ensure the security of the server.
