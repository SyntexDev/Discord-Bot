# Feature - Custom Status

The custom status feature allows server admins to set a personalized status for the bot. This status can display various types of information, such as a custom message, server-related details, or live statistics.  

Currently, the botâ€™s status is set to display the number of members in the server, updating automatically as users join or leave.
