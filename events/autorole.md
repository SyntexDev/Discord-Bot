# Feature - Auto Role  

The auto role feature automatically assigns a specified role to new members when they join the server. This ensures that every new member receives the designated role without the need for manual assignment.  

In the config you can configure which role is assigned, making it useful for welcoming new members, granting basic permissions, or organizing users into groups.  

This feature helps role management and ensures consistency across all new members.
